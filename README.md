# Speaker Recognition Using Spectrograms

Welcome to **Speaker Recognition Using Spectrograms**, a fun and innovative project that leverages the power of machine learning and audio processing to recognize speakers based on their unique voice characteristics.

## Overview

The main idea behind this project is simple but powerful: **use spectrograms to identify speakers**. We take an audio recording, convert it into a visual representation (a spectrogram), and then train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize the speaker based on these spectrograms. This approach allows us to capture the unique acoustic characteristics of each person’s voice.

Here's how it works:

- **Step 1**: **Recording the Audio**  
  The `spectrogram.py` script records audio from the user. This is your typical sound capture, but what happens next is the key to unlocking speaker Recognition.
  
- **Step 2**: **Converting to Spectrogram**  
  The recorded audio is transformed into a spectrogram using **Librosa**, a powerful Python library for audio analysis. The spectrogram is a visual representation of the frequencies present in the audio signal over time, allowing us to capture all sorts of characteristics like tone, pitch, and rhythm.

- **Step 3**: **Speaker Recognition with CNN**  
  The generated spectrogram is passed to the `train.py` script, which uses a custom-built **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to recognize and classify speakers. The CNN is trained using a helper function located in `neuronix.py`, ensuring that the model learns the distinct patterns in the spectrogram that correspond to different speakers.

## Why Spectrograms?

You might wonder, **why convert audio to spectrograms?** The reason lies in the power of visual data. While audio is a time-series signal, turning it into a spectrogram transforms it into an image-like representation, which is perfect for machine learning models like CNNs that excel at recognizing patterns in images.

By converting audio into a spectrogram, we can capture the following unique speaker characteristics:

- **Tone**: The pitch and quality of the voice.
- **Rhythm**: The patterns of speech, pauses, and speed.
- **Harmonics**: Specific resonances unique to each speaker.

These characteristics are crucial for accurately identifying speakers, and spectrograms provide an intuitive, rich format for a machine learning model to learn from.

## How to Improve Speaker Recognition

One of the challenges in speaker Recognition is the **variety of voice characteristics** that can change depending on the speaker’s emotional state, background noise, or even the recording environment. To improve accuracy, here are some suggestions:

### 1. **More Spectrograms Per User**  
   To train the model better and help it learn the distinct voice characteristics of each speaker, it's important to have multiple spectrograms for every person. The more data you have, the more robust the model will be. You can encourage users to record more samples in different environments and states.

### 2. **Record Specific Sentences**  
   To capture a wider range of vocal traits, recommend that users record a set of specific sentences that include a variety of sounds and tones. For instance, you could ask them to say sentences that include both high-pitched and low-pitched words, as well as varied intonations and pauses. This helps the model learn not just the speaker’s voice, but also how they modulate it.

   **Suggested sentences** could include:
   - "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
   - "She sells seashells by the seashore."
   - "Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers."

### 3. **Incorporating More Environmental Variations**  
   Make sure recordings are made in different environments (e.g., quiet rooms, noisy backgrounds). This allows the model to handle a range of real-world scenarios.
